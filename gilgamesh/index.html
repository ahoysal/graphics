        <h2>Overview</h2>
        GilgaMesh is a mesh editor that supports various mesh operations and some support for bezier curves and
        surfaces. The name is just a pun, there are no kings of Uruk here (yet). As a bezier editor, It is able to draw
        bezier curves at each interpolation step and move around each point to see how it affects the whole, as well as
        turn bezier surfaces into a triangle mesh. As a mesh editor, it is able to flip and split triangles, smooth
        shade models using Phong shading, and perform Loop subdivision on models.
        <br><br>
        3D modeling has always been interesting as a concept to me but I've never done it myself as it seemed like a
        kind of mystical art. It still remains that way in a sense, but this project has demystified the process a
        little by showing what tools are at modelers' disposal.


        <h2>Section I: Bezier Curves and Surfaces</h2>

        <h3>Part 1: Bezier curves with 1D de Casteljau subdivision</h3>
        De Casteljau's algorithm is a way to define a nth-degree bezier curve in terms of a parametric function over \(0
        \leq t \leq 1\). The curve is described as a recursive linear interpolation between points, where interpolating
        between the first and second point with parameter \(t\) provides the first point for the next pass, the
        interpolation of the second and third points provides the second point, etc. This is done until there is only
        one point left, which becomes the point on the curve at \(t\).
        <br><br>
        In effect, we take the point \((1-t)\) of the way along each edge connecting adjacent points, starting from the
        lower indexed point to the higher indexed point. We then connect each of those new points and do the same thing,
        taking the point between successive points \((1-t)\) along the edge, until there are no more edges.
        <br><br>
        To implement de Casteljau's algorithm, I created a function that performed one step of the process; namely, took
        in \(n+1\) points, interpolated along the edges, and returned a list of the \(n\) resulting points. Evaluating
        the full bezier curve was then just a matter of calling the function recursively until only one point remained
        and there were no more edges to interpolate.
        <br><br>
        Below is a table displaying de Casteljau's algorithm for a 5th degree bezier curve with 6 control points at each
        step of interpolation, with the newest edges and points in red. Typically bezier curves for graphics tend to be
        cubic beziers strung together, but the
        same algorithm works for any number of points greater than two. Notice how the number of points and edges
        decreases by one at each step. The final image shows the final curve, which is the parametric function defined
        by de Casteljau's from \(0 \leq t \leq 1\).

        <h3>Part 2: Bezier surfaces with separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>

        <figure style="float: inline-end;">
            <img src="images/bezTeapot.png" width="300px" />
            <figcaption>Teapot generated from bezier surface.<br>Triangles were generated from<br>sampling the bezier
                surface.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        Bezier surfaces in 3D are defined by \(n \times n\) 3D points, with interpolation over two parameters, \(u\) and
        \(v\), ranging between zero and one. Extending de Casteljau's algorithm to surfaces is simply a matter of
        evaluating the same algorithm as a curve at \(t = u\) on each row. This gives us one point per row, giving a
        total of \(n\) points. We can then feed the \(n\) resulting points into de Casteljau's algorithm for a curve
        again, with \(t = v\), giving us a single point. In total, letting \(0 \leq u, v \leq 1\) defines the parametric
        surface of the bezier surface.

        <br><br>

        Implementing 3D bezier surfaces requires almost no modification from the 2D algorithm except using 3D points to
        interpolate between, running the original algorithm \(n\) times along the rows with \(t = u\), and running the
        original algorithm one more time on the output of the \(n\) rows with \(t = v\).

        <h2>Section II: Triangle Meshes and Half-Edge Data Structure</h2>

        <h3 id="part3">Part 3: Area-weighted vertex normals</h3>
        Half-edge meshes allow for efficient calculation of area weighted vertex normals. To calculate them for a
        vertex, one must find all faces the vertex is a part of, find their normal, and weight that normal by the area
        of the face it is a part of. The weighted average of the normal of all surrounding faces should be normal of the
        vertex. Finding this normal allows for lighting calculations to be done per vertex in Gourard shading, which can
        then be interpolated using barycentric coordinates, or interpolating the normals themselves and performing the
        lighting calculations per fragment as in Phong shading.

        <br><br>
        <figure style="float: inline-end;">
            <img src="images/flatPot.png" width="300px">
            <figcaption>Flat shaded teapot.<br>Very clear edges to faces.</figcaption>
            <br>
            <img src="images/phongPot.png" width="300px">
            <figcaption>Phong shaded teapot.<br>Face edges aren't as visible.<br>Corners tend to be lighted weirdly.
            </figcaption>
        </figure>

        I assumed all faces were triangles as per the problem statement, so I had assurances that after three successive
        half-edges I would end up at the original half edge and would have traversed all half-edges of the face. Thus,
        starting at the half-edge stored by the vertex itself that points away from the vertex, I iterated through all
        three half-edges of the triangle and stored their associated source vertexes. Then, I took the cross product the
        vectors pointing from the first point to the second and third respectively, which serves as a normal scaled by
        the face's area*, and added it to an accumulated vector. Finally, I took the third edge's twin and set that as
        the start of the next face to iterate through. This works because the third edge points back to the original
        vertex, so it's twin must originate from that vertex, meaning the twin's face must be a face that surrounds the
        vertex. Using this, we enforce the invariant that the first half-edge we look at per face is the one facing away
        from the original vertex. This allows for an easy check on when to end the process– there is only one half-edge
        per face that points away from a particular vertex, and we maintain that the third edge's twin always points
        away from the original vertex, so if the twin is the same as our starting half-edge then we must have started at
        that face. Once we have the accumulated vector, we can normalize it and use it as a vertex normal.
        <br><br>
        This leaves two questions unanswered: why does the cross product serve as a normal scaled by area*? And what
        about boundaries? The latter is quite simple; if we hit a boundary while traversing the triangles around the
        vertex counter-clockwise, then there must be a boundary right of the original half-edge we started at because
        the mesh is a manifold. Thus we can continue traversing clockwise from the original triangle until we hit an
        edge, in which case we have hit both edges of the fan that emanates from the original vertex. There cannot be
        any other triangles around the point, again because the mesh is a manifold, so we can stop.
        <br><br>
        The cross product being a normal scaled by area* comes from the fact that the cross product is perpendicular to
        both vectors, and its magnitude is the area of the parallelogram that is made by the two vectors. If we divide
        the magnitude/area by two, we get half the area of the parallelogram, i.e. the area of the triangle. We also
        know the direction is normal to the surface, and because the triangles are always oriented counterclockwise we
        can calculate which direction the normal should go easily. If we accumulate all of the cross products, we will
        get the weighted normals scaled by the area of the triangle times two; however, because we eventually are going
        to normalize the accumulated cross products and the two is a constant factor, we don't have to divide it out
        because the final normalization will do so anyways.


        <h3>Part 4: Edge flip</h3>
        In theory, edge flips are simple. We just need to move a diagonal separating a quadrilateral to the other
        diagonal. With half-edges, we need to shuffle some pointers. How hard could it be? So I thought I could logic it
        out. So despite the <a
            href="https://cs184.eecs.berkeley.edu/su25/hw/hw2/section2/#mesh-pointer-recommendations">warnings</a> I
        decided to try and think through all the pointer reassignments. That went predictably bad, with faces
        disappearing left and right and segfaults galore. After trying to debug it a few times and figuring out there
        were both pointers to itself and pointer loops of length five, I finally heeded the warning and reassigned all
        of the pointers, even if they theoretically shouldn't have changed. Turns out I forgot to assign two of the six
        "next" pointers in my original implementation… Then, I was able to cull the unnecessary pointer reassignments
        using many, many drawings of triangles, checking along the way to make sure flipping still worked.
        <br><br>
        I was spending a lot of time initially trying to make sure I wasn't accessing modified pointers instead of the
        original, so to make my life easier I made copies of the originals at the very top of the function. This helped
        immensely with implementation but also with readability, as the code wasn't a jumble of
        <code>self->next()->next()->vertex()->halfedge()->face() = twin->next()->face()->next()->next()->face();</code>
        (exaggerating of course, but…).

        </figure>

        <h3 id="part5">Part 5: Edge split</h3>
        Splitting edges has many pointer reassignments like flip edge, but also creates new half-edges, edges, vertexes,
        and faces. For my own sanity, I segmented the code to set all of the pointers for each object all at the same
        time, for example assigning all the half-edge "next" pointers in one go. Drawing out the triangles then made it
        easy to see which edges should point to what, which objects needed to be created, etc. Implementing per
        functionality versus object helped me mentally focus on one task rather than having to context switch between
        each object. Partially because of this, my code worked first try, which was definitely a welcome surprise.
        <br><br>
        I also implemented support for splitting boundary edges as extra credit. To split boundary edges, you only split
        one side of the triangle. I renamed all the variables associated with one side of the triangle by adding a big
        obnoxious suffix, and from there it was easy to isolate the parts associated with that side into a
        <code>if (!isBoundary)</code> block. The refactoring was almost mechanical and after placing all the suffixed
        pointer assignments into the conditional, minimal changes had to be made to make boundary edge splits work.

        <h3>Part 6: Loop subdivision for mesh upsampling</h3>
        Loop subdivision is a two step process used to subdivide a mesh, where you split each triangle into four, then
        adjust vertex positions based on the adjacent vertices. It makes a little more sense to flip those steps in
        practice by computing the new positions first, then subdividing each triangle, and finally moving the vertexes
        into their precomputed new position.
        <br><br>
        The updated position of a vertex depends on if it was in the original mesh or not. I first computed the original
        vertexes by traversing through each of the surrounding vertices (see <a href="#part3">part 3</a>), then finding
        the new position \(p_n\) from a weighted average of the old position \(p_o\) and the \(n\) surrounding vertices'
        positions \(p_i\):
        \[
        p_n = (1 - n \cdot u) \cdot p_o + \sum^{n}_{i=1} u \cdot p_i \\
        n = \text{valence} = \text{# of old vertexes around} \\
        u =
        \begin{cases}
        \frac{3}{16} & \text{if } n = 3 \\
        \frac{3}{8n} & \text{otherwise} \\
        \end{cases}
        \]
        For each edge, we then need a new vertex to serve as endpoints for the internal subdivision edges. The new
        position is defined as a weighted average of \(\frac{3}{8}^{\text{th}}\) for each terminator of the edge it is
        on and \(\frac{1}{8}^{\text{th}}\) the opposite two sides (all vertexes of which can be accessed through
        traversing the half-edge associated with the edge or half-edge's twin). At this point in the implementation, I
        checked that all my calculations made sense by modifying the positions without subdivision, which helped me
        catch some bugs. After computing and storing these positions, we can proceed to actually modifying mesh
        topology.
        <br><br>
        Each triangle now needs to be split into four smaller triangles. We can do this by splitting each edge in the
        original mesh once. Figuring out when an edge was in the original mesh was tricky and caused many bugs, but I
        settled on marking vertices as "new" as they were added by the process and making sure neither side of the edge
        was marked as such.
        <br><br>
        Splitting the mesh was already implemented in <a href="#part5">part 5</a>, so the complexity came from marking
        <i>edges</i> as new, which was required for the next step. Note that a new edge is NOT simply an edge object
        that was not in the original mesh, since true edges in the original mesh get split into two different edge
        objects that were not part of the original mesh but do not need to be split again. Rather, a new edge is one
        that does not correspond to (half of) an edge in the original mesh. Since the edge splitting algorithm
        implementation takes the original half-edge associated with the edge and its twin and puts them on two different
        edges running parallel to the initial edge, I stored both before the split and cross referenced the edge they
        end up at with all four edges the edge splitting algorithm creates. If the edge was the same as one of the edges
        parallel to the original edge, I didn't mark it as new, and vice versa.
        <br><br>
        To ensure regularity in splitting, we now need to flip all new edges that go from a new vertex to an old vertex.
        By marking the edges as new or not, this becomes trivial; just do a check on the vertices of all new edges, flip
        as needed, and mark them as no longer new for the next pass. Debugging this, however, took a long time. I had to
        edit the mesh feature detail panel to add data on the "newness" of an edge before I realized that iterating over
        the original mesh and iterating over the "not new edges" wasn't the same thing, since two "not new edges" were
        added every time a original mesh edge was split, meaning lots of spinning wheels of death while it tried to
        recursively split all edges to infinity. I never want to look at another "isNew" variable again.
        <br><br>
        Finally, I just moved all the vertexes from their old position to the precalculated new position from the
        earlier parts, marking all vertices as old again for future iterations, and that was loop subdivision
        implemented!

        <h4>Some... quirks with Loop subdivision</h4>
        Loop subdivision usually assumes you want a smooth model, so it doesn't take well to sharp points. Points tend
        to form into smooth lumps. However, if you want to keep some sharpness, subdividing sharp triangles into smaller
        triangles gives more weight to the existing points near the sharp point, preserving some pointyness. Below is a
        table of two similar scenes at different loop subdivision levels, with the bottom row having more subdivisions
        at the base. Notice how the second row preserves more of the point.

        Another quirk is that symmetric geometries, if their topology isn't in the same symmetry group, will not retain
        those symmetries. Take for example a cube. The geometry had octahedral symmetry, yet the topology of a naïve
        cube contains only one diagonal along each face, so the topology is not symmetrical in that way. Thus the
        subdivisions are asymmetric, meaning the geometry becomes so as well after some iterations. By preprocessing to
        make the topology symmetric (for example splitting each diagonal per face into a cross), we preserve more the of
        the geometric symmetries as well.

        The base form gains a pentagonal profile in a way the original didn't have symmetrically, whereas the subdivided
        one does not and stays vaugley six-sided.
        <h4>Extra Credit: Loop subdivision on boundaries</h4>
        To implement Loop subdivision on boundaries, I found both boundaries connected to the mesh by iterating around,
        then computed the new boundary vertex position by a <a
            href="https://www.geometry.caltech.edu/pubs/DDMD16_SuppMat1.pdf">three-fourths-one-fourths weighting</a>
        between the old point position and the two neighboring boundary points. This makes the boundary still sharp
        while curving along the boundary. The cool results are below!
